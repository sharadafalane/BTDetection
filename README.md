Implemented ResNet50 for precise brain tumor identification and categorization in MRI scans.

Focused on specific brain regions through extensive model training, achieving heightened accuracy. Developed a user-friendly website for interactive use, enhancing impact in medical imaging.

In this Project we have classified MRI Images into four categories base on the location of brain tumor So it will be helpful for doctors to provide specific treatment to patient.
